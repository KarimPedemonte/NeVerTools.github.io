This is the home page of neuralverification.org, an initiative of researchers working at the [Department of Informatics, Bioengineering, Robotics and Systems Engineering](https://www.dibris.unige.it) of the [University of Genoa](https://www.unige.it).

The aim of the initiative is to develop tools that can verify neural networks and other machine learned programs as well as standard, i.e., manually written, code.
