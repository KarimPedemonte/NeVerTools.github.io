The adoption of Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs) in safety-related appli-
cations is often avoided because it is difficult to rule out possible misbehaviors with
traditional analytical or probabilistic techniques. In this paper we present NeVer,
our tool for checking safety of ANNs. NeVer encodes the problem of verifying safety
of ANNs into the problem of satisfying corresponding Boolean combinations of linear
arithmetic constraints. We describe the main verification algorithm and the structure
of NeVer. We present also empirical results confirming the effectiveness of NeVer on
realistic case studies.
