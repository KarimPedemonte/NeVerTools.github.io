In this paper we evaluate state-of-the-art SMT solvers on encodings of
verification problems involving Multi-Layer Perceptrons (MLPs), a widely used
type of neural network. Verification is a key technology to foster adoption of MLPs
in safety-related applications, where stringent requirements about performance and
robustness must be ensured and demonstrated. While safety problems for MLPs can
be attacked solving Boolean combinations of linear arithmetic constraints, the generated encodings are hard for current state-of-the-art SMT solvers, limiting our ability
to verify MLPs in practice.
